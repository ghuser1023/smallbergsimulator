Welcome to Smallberg Simulator!  

Did you ever fall asleep during a CS lecture? You will be re-living that experience again, but as a professor this time!
Your goal is to keep bad students (who are frequently falling asleep) awake!

## Controls:
Use arrow keys move Prof. Smallberg

Collide into the students to wake them up!  

## Background:
Built on Unity, music made with FL studio. Created with lots of love.
